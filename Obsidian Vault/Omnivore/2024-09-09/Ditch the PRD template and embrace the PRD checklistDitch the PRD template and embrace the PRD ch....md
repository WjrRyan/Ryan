## Highlights

> n my experience, five steps work best:
> Planning: this allows you to actually have a concrete document in the planning phase for each feature.
> Kickoff: this gets the whole team on the same page about the scope of what has been agreed to be funded.
> Solution review: this gets IC engineers aligned with what PM, design, and the tech lead have been leading thus far.
> Launch readiness: this gives everyone a good set of requirements so all teams are ready for launch.
> Impact review: this ensures the PRD is updated for traceability after launch
> So what should each checklist look like? [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/ditch-the-prd-template-and-embrace-the-prd-checklist-ditch-the-p-191d681663b#2ea4384b-cdbb-4a78-befe-6e93f11fd04a)  ^2ea4384b
