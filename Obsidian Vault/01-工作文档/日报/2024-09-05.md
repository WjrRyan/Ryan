**Slide 1: Introduction**

Hello everyone, and thank you for joining today’s session. I am Ryan the product manager of iHub, our internal learnging platform designed to streamline training and course management. Today, I’ll be walking you through the key modules of iHub and how they can enhance our learning experiences.

**Slide 2: Agenda**

Here’s a quick overview of what we’ll cover today:

1. The iHub framework

2. Course module

3. Test module

4. Enrollment module

5. Packages module

6. Video Editing and Q&A

**Slide 3: iHub Framework**

Let’s start with the iHub framework. 
For presentation layer, we have 3 portals:
We have mobile program on Trippal and User Portal,Admin Portal for Web.



  

**Slide 4: Course Module**

Moving on to the **Course Module**. This module is central to managing our courses, with three key areas:

  

• **Base Info**: Where you input fundamental course details.

• **Course Content**: This is where you define the course material.

• **Student Configuration**: This allows you to tailor the course to specific student groups.

  

Once all these configurations are complete, the course can be made available to students.

  

**Slide 5: Video Editing**

Next, let’s talk about **Video Editing**. iHub integrates with external tools like **Canva**, **Final Cut Pro**, and **CapCut** for easy video content creation. Whether you’re organizing or editing videos, you can streamline this process through these platforms.

  

**Slide 6: Associated Resources**

To further enrich the learning experience, iHub allows you to link associated resources like tests, offline training materials, certificates, and surveys to each course.

  

**Slide 7: Test Module**

Now let’s dive into the **Test Module**. This module helps you create and manage various test types, including:

  

• **Single-choice**, **Multiple-response**, **Cloze**, and **Open questions**.

  

Additionally, you can configure test papers with fixed or randomized questions, and manage the passing criteria.

  

**Slide 8: Test Configuration**

The Test Configuration options in iHub are robust. You can set limits, define a white or black list of participants, and access detailed test statistics such as answer sheets and question-by-question analysis.

  

**Slide 9: Enrollment Module**

Next, the **Enrollment Module**. This tool is perfect for managing events such as workshops, seminars, and conferences. It supports a variety of processes including notifications, registrations, approvals, check-ins, and feedback surveys.

  

**Slide 10: Packages Module**

Finally, the **Packages Module**. This module allows you to bundle courses, tests, and enrollments together into a single package, creating a seamless lifecycle for training management. You can even include external links to further enrich the package.

  

**Slide 11: Closing & Q&A**

That concludes the core of today’s presentation. In summary, iHub provides a powerful suite of tools to streamline course management, testing, and event enrollment. If you have any questions, I’d be happy to answer them now.
